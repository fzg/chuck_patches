(this is a wip, not uptodate, but partially implemented)

So 2 native ugens:
one that ticks the detune,
one that ticks the mixing

refactor the ugen so that we have one 
SuperSawDetunerParameterMaker

that we connect to 6 SuperSawDetuner that we connect to 6 SawOscs

the master osc we don't hook to that.

then we got a SuperSawMixParameterMaker that we connect to 2 gain nodes

We connect the 6 corner oscs to one of them, the master to the other


on detuneEvent: Recompute the parameter, and recompute the frequencies given the master osc is on tune.
on mixevent: update gain node levels

on frequency change: change hpf value


noteOn:
  

det => SSD.det
mix => SSD.mix

SSD => o0
 ...
SSD => o7


o0 => hpf0
